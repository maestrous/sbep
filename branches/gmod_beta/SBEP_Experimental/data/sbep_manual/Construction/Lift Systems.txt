/**LIFT SYSTEM DESIGNER**/

/*To use the Lift Designer, open the Q menu, and click on  the Lift Designer tool in the SBEP Category.*/ 

/*First, choose your desired options. The skin, (optional) doors and size of the system can be changed. 
"Enable Use Key on Housings", if ticked, means that when you press E on the wall of a floor, it will 
call the lift to that floor. (Useful if you don't want to have to add lots of wire buttons.)*/

/*Left click somewhere to open the Designer. Or if you have a specific start point in mind, you can 
right-click a suitable lift housing prop to start from there.[IMG][size=4]sbep_manual/LD_des[/IMG]*/

/*The design wizard allows you to create your lift system. The Model buttons across the top change the 
model of the currently selected part. (Some models cannot be used in certain positions in the system.) 
Below them, the Rotate and Invert buttons allow orientation of the parts.[IMG][size=4]sbep_manual/LD_models[/IMG]*/

/*Further down, you find the construction buttons. Construct will add a part with the current model and 
orientation. The position buttons allow you to move up and down the system, which you can use to change 
existing parts or rotate them as required. The Delete button removes the currently selected part. Note 
that the Construct button can only be used at the top of the system - any further down, and the other 
buttons all edit the existing parts.[IMG][size=4]sbep_manual/LD_construct[/IMG]*/

/*On the right are the camera controls, enabling you to move the camera, should you find yourself in a 
position where you can't see what you're doing.[IMG][size=3]sbep_manual/LD_cam[/IMG]*/

/*At the top-right corner of the panel is the Cancel button, which simply removes all current parts and 
exits the Designer. The Finish button at the base of the panel will complete the lift system, adding 
doors and finalising the setup.*/

/*The lift is then ready to use! Wire up some buttons to the lift itself, and sail between different 
floors effortlessly, and without any pesky sliders!*/
