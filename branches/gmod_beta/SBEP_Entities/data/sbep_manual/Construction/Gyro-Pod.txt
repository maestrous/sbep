/*A Gyro is a quick, efficient method of getting a ship in the air.*/

/*To spawn a Gyro, open the Q-menu, go to the SBEP category, and click on the Gyro-Pod tool. 
Right-click to spawn a gyro. Left-click all the props you want to link to the Gyro (usually 
every prop in the ship), then left-click the gyro to link them. Linking a vehicle pod to the 
Gyro will make that vehicle the controller for the Gyro.*/

/*Once the Gyro is linked to the ship, get in your chair or pod. Pressing spacebar will turn 
on the Gyro. Shift and Alt increase and decrease speed, while W,A,S and D are used to steer. 
Alternatively, you can press R (or your reload key) to switch to mouse control, where A and D 
control roll, and the mouse controls yaw and pitch.*/
