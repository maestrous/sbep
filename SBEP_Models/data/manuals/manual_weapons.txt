Weapons Systems>T<Fire1 {Default: LMB} to Fire 1-9 on the left side of the arms report.
Fire2 {Default: RMB} to Fire 1-9 on the right side of the arms report.

Arming Left Arms Report: Hit 1-9 to arm that slot.
Arming Right Arms Report: Hold ALT and Hit 1-9 to arm that slot.

Bright Green: Armed
Dark Green: Disarmed

Note: At times you may have to 'cycle' all your weapon ports once to make them properly armed. This is accomplished by arming each slot (the slot
turns bright green), dearming each slot(the slot returns to dark green), and then rearming each slot. Once done this should arm/disarm that weapon
port properly afterwords.

BEAM CANNON:  To use these, you have to wire "Config" to a number.
Config1 = Not Implemented
Config2 = Green Slasher
Config3 = Gold Slasher
Config4 = Green Cannon
Config5 = Gold Cannon
If you don't wire a Configuration, then the cannon will NOT work.  Attempting to fire it will result in an error and the cannon being unusable.
