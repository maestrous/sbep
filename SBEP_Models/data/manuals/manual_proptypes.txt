Prop Types>T<As of right now, there are 3 main prop types:  Smallbridge, Mediumbridge, and Kreigshield.

Smallbridge (known as SB from here on) is generally used for smaller ships, hence the name.  SB has two main sizes, singlewide (SW) and doublewide
(DW).  These are interchangable through parts available in the "Splitters" category.

Mediumbridge (henceforth MB) parts are larger then SB.  Instead of differences in width, MB parts are divided by size.  Available sizes are Single High
(SH), Double High (DH), Triple High (TH), and inverse (similar to SH, but upside down).  All parts are fully interchangable with each other.

In the "Splitters" category, there are parts to go between SB and MB.

The third available parts are Kreigshield (KS).  These are used for bases on the surfaces of planets.  Of the three types, KS are the least developed,
and more are soon to come.
