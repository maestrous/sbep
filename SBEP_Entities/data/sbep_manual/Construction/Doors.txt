/**DOORS**/

/*SBEP doors are an easy, more efficient alternative to making doors with hydraulics, 
forcers, or other setups involving copious amounts of wire. All the models are animated, 
and are also fully wire-compatible.*/

/*To spawn an SBEP door, open the Q menu, and click on the Door tool in the SBEP Category.*/

/*Several settings can be changed. "Enable Use Key" means that pressing E on the doorframe 
will open and close the door (if selected, a wire input is also created to allow this 
to be disabled freely. "Create Wire Inputs" decides whether or not wire inputs will be 
created. You must have at least one of these two settings enabled. (Otherwise the door 
would be unopenable!)*/

/*Below the options, is the model panel. A wide range of models is available for different 
purposes, split into categories to make finding the right one easier. All models have all 
possible doors added to them - if any of them are unwanted, simply remove them with the 
Remover tool.[IMG][size=4]sbep_manual/Dr_menu[/IMG]*/
